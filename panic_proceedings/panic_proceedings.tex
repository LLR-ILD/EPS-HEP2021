\abstract{
The Higgsstrahlung process as a Higgs boson production mechanism at a lepton collider
provides access to a high-purity Higgs boson sample.
The Higgs branching ratios can be measured simultaneously
by analysing the data inclusively.
For this purpose, we divide the sample into classes that
distinguish reasonably well between the Higgs decay modes.
These class counts are associated to the Higgs branching ratios through a
model-independent fit.
The fit provides an estimate for each of the Higgs branching ratios with
the full matrix of statistical correlations between the channels.
These are pure branching ratio measurements,
independent of any Higgs production mode cross section measurement.

We present a study on data simulated for the ILD concept
at the International Linear Collider (ILC) at 250~\GeV center-of-mass energy.

\section{Introduction}
The International Linear Collider (ILC) will initially collide polarized beams
of electrons and positrons at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=250~\GeV$ (ILC250).
This energy will then be increased up to $\sqrt{s}=500~\GeV$~\cite{ILC_Staging_2017}.
The ILD concept group proposes the International Linear Detector~\cite{ILD_DBD,ILD_IDR}
as a detector for the ILC.
Its silicon trackers allow to measure impact parameters to less than 5~{\textmu}m~\cite{ILD_IDR}.
With the help of a Time Projection Chamber, transverse momenta of charged particles
can be measured with a resolution of $\sigma(1/p_T) = 2 \cdot 10^{-5}~\GeV^{-1}$~\cite{ILD_IDR}.
The highly granular electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters
are based on the concept of Particle Flow
for track reconstruction and particle identification~\cite{ParticleFlow}.
A jet energy resolution of 3-4\% can be achieved~\cite{ILD_IDR}.
The surrounding coil provides a magnetic field of 3~T.

Here we focus on the Higgs boson production capabilities at the ILC250.
It will produce a large number of Higgs boson events.
The dominant Higgs production mode is Higgsstrahlung: $e^+e^- \to ZH$.
The background rates are low compared to hadron colliders.

One of the improvements compared to
a previously presented version of the study~\cite{LCWS_combined_Higgs}
is the inclusion of the Standard Model (SM) background processes in the result.

\section{Event selection}\label{sec:selection}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{
        Cut flow for the event selection in the $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ sample.
        The last figure shows the efficiency and purity after each step.
    }\label{fig:presel}
\end{figure}

We target Higgsstrahlung events in which the primary Z boson decays leptonically,
$Z \to e^+ e^-$ or $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$.
Event variables can be reconstructed after the isolated lepton pair is identified
and combined with FSR photon candidates.
Figure~\ref{fig:presel} shows the distribution of signal and background for
$Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ for the variables
that were built from the primary Z boson's decay products.
% The cuts from the previous steps are already applied in the subsequent steps.
Lepton colliders have the advantage that the initial state kinematics is known.
This is used when defining the recoil mass:
$M_{\mathrm{recoil}}^2 = s + M_Z^2 - 2\sqrt{s} \cdot E_Z$.
For signal events, the distribution peaks at $M_{\mathrm{recoil}} = M_{\mathrm{Higgs}}$.
The cuts presented in Figure~\ref{fig:presel} lead to a sample
with about 50\% purity at 50\% signal efficiency.
By definition, the efficiency is constant over Higgs decay modes
and the resulting sample is thus unbiased.

    \caption{
        Expected contributions per class from each of the Higgs decay modes.
    }\label{fig:box_counts}
\end{wrapfigure}

We will now build a binned distribution of expected counts from the sample,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:box_counts}.
Each bin contains the events that fall into a specific class.
For the shown bin counts, Standard Model branching ratios are assumed..
The black dots additionally contain the background contribution
to the $Z \to \mu^+\mu^-$ Higgsstrahlung sample after event selection.
The class definitions can be found in the appendix of~\cite{LCWS_combined_Higgs}.
They were chosen so that they distinguish
relatively well between the considered Higgs decay modes.
The last bin contains all events that do not match any class definition.
The relative sensitivity to a Higgs decay mode varies between bins.
Next, we will present a fit that uses this variation in sensitivity
to derive the Higgs branching ratios (BRs).


\section{Branching ratio uncertainties}\label{sec:fit}

\subsection{Setting up the fit}

        The optimum of the fit and its uncertainty are indicated as orange error bars.
        The starting values of the fit are always the Standard Model Higgs BRs.
        The considered scenarios are the SM BRs (left)
        and a BSM scenario described in the text.
        For the BSM scenario, the BRs that were injected in the data sample
        are labeled as \textit{Data truth}.

        and their absolute statistical uncertainties.

    }\label{fig:brs}
\end{figure}

The class probabilities for each Higgs decay mode or background process can
be determined using simulated events.
They are combined into a matrix, where each column corresponds to one process.
Applying the truth vector of the process counts to this matrix yields the class counts.
Conversely, given the class counts, a fit can be performed to gain access to the
process counts.
Only the relative contribution of each Higgs BR is taken as a free parameter.
% The fit is performed by \texttt{iminuit}~\cite{Minuit,iminuit}
% with a multinomial log-likelihood as its cost function.
With the nine BRs considered in the current analysis,
the fit provides the prediction for eight free parameters
and the corresponding $8 \times 8$ covariance matrix.
They can be converted into mean values and uncertainties for each of the BRs.

\subsection{Results}

In the following we assume a dataset collected at the left-polarized
(80\% left-polarized electron beam, 30\% right-polarized positron beam)
ILC250 with 2000~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.
Figure~\ref{fig:brs} gives the resulting values for a combination of the
$Z \to e^+e^-$ and $Z \to \mu^+\mu^-$ primary Z boson channels.
The left panel of the figure shows the result in the SM case.
The central panel supports the claim that the method
is truly model independent.
Here we assume a model with $BR(H \to b \bar{b})$ decreased by $15\%$,
and $BR(H \to W^+W^-)$ increased by $15\%$.
While this is an unrealistically large deviation from the SM, this shows that
the procedure still works far away from the SM hypothesis.


The (absolute) $1 \sigma$-uncertainties are listed in the table on the right side
of Figure~\ref{fig:brs}.
These values assume BRs close to the SM expectation.
Additional non-SM Higgs decays
($H \to \textrm{invisible}$ $H \to \mu^+\tau^-, H \to b\bar{c}$, \ldots)
could be added to obtain explicit upper limits for them.


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The Higgsstrahlung process at a lepton collider allows the measurement of
all Higgs branching ratios (BRs) at once within the same unbiased sample.
At a Higgs factory such as the ILC250, the method presented in this contribution
can be applied to perform precision measurements of the observed BRs
and to obtain upper limits for additional Higgs decays.
It is a pure BR measurement, independent of any production cross section measurement.
The results can be combined with any analysis that does not use the
$ZH \to \left( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^- \right)$ channels.
