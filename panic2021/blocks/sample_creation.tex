\begin{block}{2. Sample creation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Events without the part identified as from the recoiling Z boson.
    \item Create bins inspired by the expected decays, with established tools.
    \item E.g. \texttt{bb\_tight}:
        No Isolated leptons or photons in event.\\
        Require \texttt{LCFIPlus} btag1 $>$ 0.8 for event clustered into two jets.
    \end{itemize}
